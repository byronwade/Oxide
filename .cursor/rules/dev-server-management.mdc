# Development Server Management

## Clean Development Server Startup Protocol

When starting or restarting the development server, ALWAYS follow this sequence:

### 1. Cancel Existing Processes
- **Kill any running dev processes** before starting new ones
- Check for and terminate any processes running on port 3000 or other dev ports
- Use `pkill -f "next dev"` or `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9` if needed

### 2. Clear Next.js Cache
- **Always delete the `.next` directory** before starting development
- This prevents caching issues and ensures clean builds
- Command: `rm -rf .next`

### 3. Start Fresh Development Server
- Use the preferred package manager: **Bun** (as specified in user preferences)
- Command: `bun dev`
- Verify the server starts cleanly on http://localhost:3000

## Implementation Commands

```bash
# Complete clean restart sequence
pkill -f "next dev" 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf .next
bun dev
```

## When to Apply This Rule

- **Every time** you start a development server
- When switching between different development tasks
- After making significant configuration changes to [next.config.ts](mdc:next.config.ts)
- When encountering unexpected caching or build issues
- Before running development after editing [package.json](mdc:package.json)

## Additional Considerations

- Also clear `node_modules/.cache` if persistent issues occur
- Consider clearing browser cache for complete fresh start
- Monitor for any lingering processes that might interfere with development

This ensures optimal performance and prevents cache-related development issues in the LaunchBeacon project.
