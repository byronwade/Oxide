# Oxide Design Philosophy

## Core Principle
**Minimalistic, UX-first design with a black and rust theme.**

## Inspiration
The design language is inspired by **Vercel**, prioritizing clarity, performance, and a modern aesthetic.

## Key Requirements
- **Retina-Ready:** All assets must be high-resolution. Use SVGs where possible.
- **Native Feel:** Applications must feel integrated with their host OS. The desktop app should not feel like a simple web wrapper.
- **Seamless AI Integration:** AI features should feel like a natural extension of the UI, not a tacked-on element. Use subtle glow effects and accents (`rust` color) to denote AI-powered components.
- **Performance First:** Animations and interactions must be smooth (target 60fps). Avoid layout shifts and prioritize fast load times.
- **Color Palette:**
    - **Primary Actions:** Use rust colors (`#cd7f32`, `#b87333`).
    - **Backgrounds:** Use black variants (`#000000`, `#0a0a0a`, `#111111`).
    - **Text:** White for primary, gray for secondary information.
    - **NO GRADIENTS.**
