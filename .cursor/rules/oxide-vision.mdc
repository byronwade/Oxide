# Oxide Project Vision & Core Principles

## Vision

Our mission is to create the most developer-friendly and player-focused gaming platform in the world, dethroning incumbent legacy platforms by being faster, more open, fairer, and smarter.

## Core Pillars

Development should align with the four foundational pillars:

1.  **Player Experience & Discovery:** Focus on hyper-personalized, seamless, and instant gaming experiences. Prioritize AI-driven discovery and unified cross-platform access.
2.  **Creator & Community Ecosystem:** Empower developers with powerful tools, transparent systems, and a thriving modding community.
3.  **Economic Models & Digital Ownership:** Support dynamic monetization and explore pathways for true digital asset ownership.
4.  **Technical Excellence:** Uphold uncompromising standards for speed, reliability, and performance.

## Guiding Principles

-   **Faster:** Sub-200ms interactions and optimized content delivery.
-   **More Open:** Commitment to DRM-optional policies and a powerful, public-facing API.
-   **Fairer:** A developer-first revenue model (95/5 split) and transparent systems.
-   **Smarter:** AI-enhanced features at every level of the ecosystem.
